          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How a Late-Night Idea Became a Free Toolbox</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Calcuzy.app started on a random night in my college dorm room. I’m <strong>Akshat Thakur</strong>, a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student who loves building things that are clean, fast, and genuinely helpful. There was no big startup plan—just a simple question: <em>“What if simple tools, when done right, could actually help people?”</em>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            That question led to a few hours of coding, a lot of curiosity, and the birth of Calcuzy. What began as a hands-on project for learning web development has grown into a platform with 31 free tools for students, professionals, and everyday use.

          <p className="mb-4">
            I’ve been learning web development for less than a year, and Calcuzy became my hands-on project to learn full-stack development, SEO, and how to build useful tools that last. Every line of code, every UI tweak, and every new tool is a step in that journey.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why I Built Calcuzy</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>I wanted a long-term project that grows over time</li>
            <li>I wanted to build clean, useful tools people can rely on</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how far a simple idea can go with consistent work</li>
            <li>I love the challenge of creating something from scratch</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Calcuzy is not a one-month project—it’s something I plan to build slowly, improve constantly, and grow into a real online utility hub.

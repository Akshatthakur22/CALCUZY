💸 AdSense Revenue Optimization Strategy
I am writing this as your mentor, Akki:
You will earn the MOST from ads if you follow EXACT UI/UX + placement rules.
1. Use only 3 ad placements per page
Too many ads kill trust → drop traffic → lower revenue.
Placement Strategy
1. Just below the H1 title
2. Mid-content (after 1st section)
3. Just above the footer
These are proven highest CTR positions.
2. Use white background everywhere
Why?
* Ads blend more naturally
* Looks more premium
* Users stay longer
* Higher ad viewability score
* Google rewards clean layouts
3. Keep paragraphs short
Short text forces scrolling → more ad impressions.
4. Put content above the fold
Never put an ad before your main heading.
5. Site speed matters more than design
The faster your site loads → the more Google ranks you → the more earnings.
